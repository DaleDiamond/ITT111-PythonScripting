# ITT111-PythonScripting
This repository contains Python scripting assignments and demonstrations completed in the ITT-111 course.

The scripts were developed and executed using PyCharm and focus on foundational scripting concepts such as input validation, conditional logic, loops and basic automation tasks relevant to IT and Cybersecurity environments. 

Screenburst recordings are included to demonstrate script execution, debudding, and environment set up.
